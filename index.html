          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>
            Belt Tests: belt tests will be held during the last 10 minutes of
            each music class as well as before and after school on certain
            days/times. Please find the sign up sheet in the music classroom to
            sign up for belt tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            To receive your belt, you must play the piece of music with NO
            MISTAKES. This means you must play with appropriate tone, correct
            rhythms and pitches, and breathe in the appropriate places. Each
            student is allowed ONE restart/do-over for a belt test. If you do
            not receive your belt after a test, you have to wait until the next
            week to test. Only ONE test per week is allowed. You may not test
            for multiple belts in the same week.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have received your Black Belt in Recorder Karate, you will be
            able to move on to Recorder Karate LEVEL 2 (in process).
